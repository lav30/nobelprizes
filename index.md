# Analysis of Nobel Prizes through Visualizations

## Project Overview 

- Explored Nobel Prizes awarded over a period of a hundred years through detailed vizualizations.
- Explored different vizualization methods such as Seaborn and Plotly to effectively display the data
- Detailed analysis of what contributes to being a Nobel Prize awardee.


## Data Exploration 

Data exploration through vizualization always provides interesting insights into a dataset. This vizualization project has focused on Nobel prizes awarded over a period of more than a hundred years. These data explorations through bar graphs and scatter plots provide a clear picture of the background of the awardees. Several columns contain missing values and these can also be vizualized through Python modules. Although it is not apparent why there are so few female awardees over the years, key insights about the dataset can be obtainbed through age, gender and category related visualizations.

### Missing Values Visualized 

The graphs below illustrate the number of missing values in each column.

 ### Number of Nobel Prizes Awarded over the Years in all Categories


![Title](Images/a.png?raw=true "Title")


### 1. By Gender 

- Males are more likely to be awarded a Nodel Prize in all categories.
- Females are more likely to receive a Nobel Prize in Peace or Literature
- Females awarded too few Physics and Economics awards to produce a box plot. 




### 2. By Category

- Median age lower for females in Chemistry, Peace and Physics.
- 


### 3. By Age 

- Economics and Literature have the highest median age to receive a Nobel Prize.
- Physics laureates are the youngest among all prize categories.
